 1. Problem Transformation (treat the problem as single label problem)
    a) binary relevance  --> divide the problem into single lable problem
    b) classifier chains --> each time add the number of label to the classifier
    c) label powerset --> label the data based on similar value
 2. Adopted algorithm --> use MLkNN (Multi Label K Nearest Neigbours) algorithm to classify the problem, random forest also multilabel solving algorithm
 3. Ensemble approach -->
